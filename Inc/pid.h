  /**
   * @defgroup PID PID Motor Control
   *
   * A Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller is a generic feedback control
   * loop mechanism widely used in industrial control systems.
   * A PID controller is the most commonly used type of feedback controller.
   *
   * This set of functions implements (PID) controllers
   * for Q15, Q31, and floating-point data types.  The functions operate on a single sample
   * of data and each call to the function returns a single processed value.
   * <code>S</code> points to an instance of the PID control data structure.  <code>in</code>
   * is the input sample value. The functions return the output value.
   *
   * \par Algorithm:
   * <pre>
   *    y[n] = y[n-1] + A0 * x[n] + A1 * x[n-1] + A2 * x[n-2]
   *    A0 = Kp + Ki + Kd
   *    A1 = (-Kp ) - (2 * Kd )
   *    A2 = Kd  </pre>
   *
   * \par
   * where \c Kp is proportional constant, \c Ki is Integral constant and \c Kd is Derivative constant
   *
   * \par
   * \image html PID.gif "Proportional Integral Derivative Controller"
   *
   * \par
   * The PID controller calculates an "error" value as the difference between
   * the measured output and the reference input.
   * The controller attempts to minimize the error by adjusting the process control inputs.
   * The proportional value determines the reaction to the current error,
   * the integral value determines the reaction based on the sum of recent errors,
   * and the derivative value determines the reaction based on the rate at which the error has been changing.
   *
   * \par Instance Structure
   * The Gains A0, A1, A2 and state variables for a PID controller are stored together in an instance data structure.
   * A separate instance structure must be defined for each PID Controller.
   * There are separate instance structure declarations for each of the 3 supported data types.
   *
   * \par Reset Functions
   * There is also an associated reset function for each data type which clears the state array.
   *
   * \par Initialization Functions
   * There is also an associated initialization function for each data type.
   * The initialization function performs the following operations:
   * - Initializes the Gains A0, A1, A2 from Kp,Ki, Kd gains.
   * - Zeros out the values in the state buffer.
   *
   * \par
   * Instance structure cannot be placed into a const data section and it is recommended to use the initialization function.
   *
   * \par Fixed-Point Behavior
   * Care must be taken when using the fixed-point versions of the PID Controller functions.
   * In particular, the overflow and saturation behavior of the accumulator used in each function must be considered.
   * Refer to the function specific documentation below for usage guidelines.
